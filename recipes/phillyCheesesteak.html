    <h2>Tender, well-marbled steak, sautéed onions, and melty provolone cheese served in a soft but sturdy hoagie roll define this classic Philly sandwich.</h2>



    <p>At its core, the sandwich has just three elements: beef, cheese, and bread. No fancy sauces, no vibrant complimentary veggies, not even a crunchy topping. So what’s all the fuss about? Sure, you could argue that there are better Philly-based sandwiches (a lot of locals would order a roast pork with broccoli rabe before a cheesesteak), but when the simple and humble cheesesteak is done well, you can see why its the city's most famous sandwich.</p>
    <p>Thinly shaved, super beefy rib eye is finely chopped on a well-loved flat-top, and then slowly browned in its own fat and juices. Cheese is folded in and melted into the meat to add even more richness and a bit of sharpness for contrast, while also serving as a delicious edible glue to hold all of the delicate pieces of rib eye together. A hearty portion of the cheese-laced rib eye is then flipped into a hoagie roll that’s sturdy enough to hold up to all that wonderful fattiness, but supple and soft enough to sink your teeth into with little resistance.</p>

    <h2>Recipe</h2>

    <ul>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <li>1 pound (454g) boneless rib eye steak or skirt steak or store-bought pre-sliced rib eye (see notes)1 tablespoon (15ml) vegetable or other neutral oil</li>
        <li>1/2 medium yellow onion (4 ounces; 114g), cut into 1/4-inch dice</li>
        <li>8 thin slices provolone cheese (about 6 ounces; 160g), 4 slices torn into 1-inch pieces and 4 slices left whole</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt use half as much by volume</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Two 7- to 8-inch-long Italian hoagie/sub rolls, split lengthwise, but left attached on 1 side to create a hinge</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <li>If using a whole steak, trim and cut steak crosswise with grain into roughly 3-inch wide sections, then set on large plate and freeze until firm but not frozen solid, about 1 hour. If using pre-sliced steak, skip to chopping instructions in Step 2.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Using a sharp knife, shave steak as thin as possible on a biased angle against the grain. Mound shaved meat on cutting board and chop coarse with knife, about 5 times for store-bought sliced meat or 10 times for hand-sliced.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat an empty 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat for 5 minutes. Add oil to skillet and heat until just smoking. Add meat and onion in an even layer and cook, without stirring, until well browned on one side, 4 to 6 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring frequently to move and pull apart the meat slices until meat and onions are browned and meat is no longer pink, 2 to 4 minutes. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Stir in torn provolone cheese, Parmesan cheese (if using), salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until cheese is melted and well combined, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn off heat.  Divide mixture into 2 individual portions the length of the rolls. Shingle 2 slices of Provolone cheese over each portion. Cover and let cheese melt, about 1 minute.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Center rolls, cut sides down, over each portion of meat. Working with one at a time, use a large spatula to scoop under each portion of meat and flip meat into roll to create a filled sandwich. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
